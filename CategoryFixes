To get a list of the movie categories I ran the following code:

``` 
SELECT name
FROM category
``` 

At this moment I noticed that several categories were missing and decided to add them to the database

```
INSERT INTO category(name)
VALUES ('Thriller'),('Crime'),('Mystery'),('Romance'),('War')
```

With the new values added I ran some checks and discovered that one movie was incorrectly categorized

```
SELECT film_id
FROM film
WHERE title = 'African Egg'
```

To fix this issue I ran the following code

```
UPDATE film_category
SET category_id = 19
WHERE film_id = 5
```

Final step for this section was to drop the Mystery genre since there were no movies in this category

```
DELETE FROM category
WHERE name = 'Mystery
```
