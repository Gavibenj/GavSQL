### To find the top 10 and bottom 10 films by popularity

SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount, D.title, D.rating, F.name AS genre
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category E ON D.film_id = E.film_id
INNER JOIN category F ON E.category_id = F.category_id
GROUP BY title, rating, genre
ORDER BY total_amount DESC

### Finding the min, max, average, and count of films based on the number of times it was rented, the replacement cost, and the rental cost

SELECT MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost,
MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost,
AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration,
AVG(replacement_cost) AS avg_replacement_cost,
COUNT(rental_rate) AS count_rent_values,
COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_rental_duration_values,
COUNT(replacement_cost) AS count_replacement_cost_values,
COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM film

### Ordering the top 10 countries by the number of customers

SELECT D.country, COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY number_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 10

### To create the map showcasing which countires have the most customers

SELECT country,
       COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS customer_count,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON a.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY country

### Creating a bar chart showing the largest customers

SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur',
Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
