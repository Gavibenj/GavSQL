# GavSQL
My first SQL project for GitHub

For this project I queried a large data set for a movie rental company to draw insights about inventory, regional purchases, and customer preference.

Key Questions:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
